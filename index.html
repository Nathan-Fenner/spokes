    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This is a demo of a strategy map generation scheme I'm working on.</p>
    <h2>Development Details</h2>
    <p>
        This project was written in TypeScript, with no other external dependencies.
        <a href="https://github.com/Nathan-Fenner/spokes">The source is available here.</a>
        Note that if you're reading the source, you should skip the <code>.js</code> files and the <code>build/</code> directories.
        These are generated (except for <code>moduler.js</code>, which is a stub that lets webpack+TS work) and therefore not the source I work with.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main interface logic and rendering is found in <code>main.ts</code>.
        The generation code is found in <code>generation.ts</code>.
        A type-safe (but extremely incomplete) webgl library that I've developed for this project can be found in <code>glacial.ts</code>.
        Matrix helper functions and type definitions can be found in <code>matrix.ts</code>
    </p>
    <h2>Generation Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
        Here I talk about what I did, and what I tried but didn't work.
    </p>
    <p>
        The general architecture of the code is as <em>functional</em> as I could make it, within reason.
        In general, I try to create a piece of data, then pass it into the next step, rather than mutating it in place.
        This makes the types simpler and reduces the chance of errors or weird behavior.
        You should consider it too!
    </p>
    <h3>Hexagons</h3>
    <p>
        Although hexagon terrain has become more popular in strategy games, it's not seen in too many other places.
        Dealing with square grids seems much easier as a programmer, since they can be obviously built by nesting two arrays.
        Hexagon grids don't have to be much harder to work with.
        You just have to build the right tools!
        In my case, that involved two basic functions:
        (A) the ability to get the neighbors of a hex position,
        (B) the ability to take a hex position and map it into a place in the world.
        There are of course many others that I use, but these two fundamental concepts, once solved, make dealing with hex grids hardly more difficult than dealing with square grids.
        The main trick is to get used to using them <em>instead of</em> constantly reaching for </code>for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {...}</code>-style loops.
        Honestly, you should probably be doing this anway- the abstraction makes it much easier to understand what's going on, so I think it would help just as much, if not more, in projects that deal exclusively with square grids too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hexagon grids actually <em>can</em> be represented pretty easily using a square grid.
        All you do is add extra adjacency to each square- the top-right and bottom-left diagonals get connected too.
        <a href="http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">This is probably the best resource on the internet for games using hexagons.</a>
        I didn't reference it specifically while working on this project, but it still has the best illustrations of these concepts that I've seen.
    </p>
    <h3>Island Shape</h3>
    <p>
        The shape of the island (in terms of what is land and what's not) is determined before anything else is done.
    </p>
    <p>
        The island itself is "grown" from an initial seed of a single hexagon.
        A cell is uniformly chosen, and one of its six neighbors is picked at random.
        If it's not already used, then that cell is added to the island.
        This repeats until 
    </p>
    <p>
        If this was all that was done, the island would usually come out as a round blob.
        In order to get interesting shapes, "avoider" points are randomly scattered near the origin.
        An "avoider" creates an area of influence around itself.
        Cells that expand near the influence of an avoider can be rejected, where the generator will start again by choosing another hex to grow from.
        Avoiders can't completely prevent cells from growing- they can only greatly reduce the probability of growth.
        This makes it very unlikely that the island will get stuck in this stage.
        However, this does mean that having lots of avoiders is the same as having none-
        if everywhere is avoided equally, then there will be no biased introduced so you'll just get a blob again.
    </p>
    <h3>Height</h3>
    <p>
        Once the shape of the island has been determined, the heightmap is built.
        The heightmap is "grown" in a similar manner to the mass itself.
        Every hex has a height between 0 and 8 (inclusive).
        One hex is assigned a height to start.
        From here, hexes are randomly chosen and expand into their neighbors, much like the island's growth.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a cell expands into an open neighbor (one that hasn't been assigned a height yet),
        it gives that neighbor a height that's "walkable" from itself.
        For the purposes of this project, that means that the height is either its own, or one up (+1) or one down (-1) from it.
        Heights that go out of range (below 0 or above 8) are clamped to be in range.
    </p>
    <p>
        A general smoothness parameter determines how likely it is that the height will vary or stay the same.
        I've found that high smoothness values (around 80% or so of "stay the same" probability)
        produces extremely boring, flat maps, so I only use much lower values.
        I've found that there's not much qualitative difference in maps generated by different smoothness values once you apply the next step.
    </p>
    <h3>Smoothing</h3>
    <p>
        Terrain generated by the above growing scheme (especially with low smoothness) tends to be very "jagged" or "rough".
        In particular, there's not a lot of flat, open areas, which tend to be nicer for strategic elements.
        However, it's important for visual and strategic interest (in this project) that cliff structures still exist.
        Therefore, I employ a smoothing process which is intended to smooth regions that can be made flatter,
        without sacrificing large cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea is pretty simple.
        Smoothing occurs in a series of identical passes.
        Each pass applies a smoothing operation to each hex.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any hex of height <code>h</code> with more neighbors of height <code>h+1</code> than neighbors of height <code>h</code> will become height <code>h+1</code>
        <em>provided that</em> it doesn't have any neighbors of height <code>h-1</code>.
        The same is true in the other direction.
        The condition on having no neighbors in the other direction here is very important:
        it ensures that smoothing can't introduce discontinuities in the hex grid.
        In particular, any walkable neighbors of a hex before smoothing will still be walkable neighbors after smoothing. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It's important to note that the converse isn't true.
        Some hex neighbors that weren't walkable before
        (in particular, neighbors with height <code>h+2</code> in the above)
        <em>will</em> become walkable afterwards.
        Originally, I added this as a restriction to try to protect "interesting" terrain features like cliffs,
        because I was worried that smoothing would eliminate them.
        However, this turned out to be unnecessary.
        Preventing these new neighbors from occuring basically prevents smoothing everywhere, except for a few hexes at the very top or very bottom of the world.
        In addition (as you can see) there are still plenty of cliffs, mesas, and valleys left behind without it.
    </p>
    <h3>Presentation</h3>
    <p>
        The presentation uses WebGL, a web technology for 3D rendering.
        I didn't use any outside libraries, mostly because I wanted to keep this project fairly small and dependency-free
        (although I'll admit that TypeScript is a pretty heft dependency, even if it's only for development).
    </p>
    <p>
        Generation assigns each hex an integer height from 0 to 8.
        In order to make it clearer which hex borders are "walkable",
        the corners of hexes have their heights adjusted so that walkable hexes share a border.
    </p>
    <p>
        This might sound complicated at first (I thought it was before I tried it), but it's really not.
        If you take a look at any corner of any hex, you'll see that it's used by 3 hexes.
        There are really only a few interesting cases!
    </p>
    <p>
        If none of the hexes are walkable, then there's no need to adjust their heights.
        Similarly if they're all the same, or two are the same and the third is very different.
    </p>
    <p> 
        This leaves only two cases: there is a "staircase" with heights <code>h</code>, <code>h+1</code>, and <code>h+2</code>,
        or there is a "ramp" with heights <code>h</code>, <code>h</code> and <code>h+1</code> (or vice versa).
    </p>
    <p>
        In the case of a staircase, the corners are all assigned height <code>h+1</code>.
        This leads to basic connectivity.
        There's an unfortunate special case that occurs if a <code>h</code> hex is adjacent to a <code>h+2</code> hex,
        with a <code>h+1</code> hex on both sides- both corners will be brought to height <code>h+1</code> which makes them look like they're walkable!
        This is essentially remedied by the cliffs that are inserted later, which resolves this issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the "ramp" case, things are a lot easier. Any number between <code>h</code> and <code>h+1</code> would work.
        I tried the average (which is slightly biased towards the majority) as well as the middle (biasing equally towards each)
        but I eventually settled on the majority (whichever there are more of).
        The primary reason for this was because it tended to produce flatter land, which I liked the look of.
    </p>
    <h3>Graphical Features</h3>
    <p>
        Grass and rocks are randomly passed on some hexes to add some visual flair.
        Each blade of grass is just a couple triangles, and they're arranged in a clump to create some structure.
        The rocks are just cones embedded into the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        The much more interesting feature is the cliff walls.
        Without the stones jutting out of the sides, they look very flat and featureless (because they are!).
        To fix this, I created the cliff walls.
        They're not really that complicated if you look closely-
        each cliff edge gets two boxes to place at random locations along the edge.
        The boxes have a height that's just a little above the top,
        and a random width and length for variety.
        In addition, if the cliff is tall enough (primarily to conserve triangles) there are additional
        boxes places (with darker colors) lower down on the cliff.
        To make sure they're visible, they're also much wider.
        These are mostly noticeable around the outside.
    </p>
    <h3>Lighting and Colors</h3>
    <p>
        The lighting is purely Lambertian, with a very basic shadow map used to create shadows.
        At the current moment, the shadow map is using a 512x512 color image to store depth, which leads to very noticeable artifacts.
        I'm hoping to replace it with a proper 16-bit depth buffer soon.
